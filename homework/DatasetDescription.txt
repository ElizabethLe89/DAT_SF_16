2. Describe content of the dataset
 Dataset is based on 768 females at least 21y/o of Pima Indian heritage from Phoenix, Ariona 
 and includes 8 attributes plus class. Attributes include number of times pregnant, plasma glucose 
 concentration a 2hrs in oral glucose tolerance test, diastolic blood pressure (mm HG), triceps 
 skin fold thickness(mm) 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml), body mass index (weight kg/height 
 in m^2), diabetes pedigree function, age, respectively and class variable (0-negative, 
 1-positive)
 
3. Describe the features and formulate hypothesis
 Features of the dataset include 4 files related to cost- cost, delay, expense and group. Cost
 is based in Canadian dollars from the Ontario Health Insurance Program's fee schedule. Delay 
 accounts for tests which are either "delayed" or "immediate". Expense accounts for full cost or 
 discount cost of the test, typical difference between full and discounted is $2.10. Group file
 is meant to be used with expense file. When tests are done in groups, there may be discounts. 
 Attributes that would be useful in predicting diabetes would be correlation of age, BMI, higher 
 Diabetes pedigree function and number of pregnancies with testing positive for diabetes.
